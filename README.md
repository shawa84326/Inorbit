# Robotics System for Healthcare

This repository contains the code, demo video, and a presentation PDF for the robotics system developed for healthcare in collaboration with the robotic startup "InOrbit".

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a robotic system aimed at aiding healthcare environments. The system allows patients and medical staff to request and receive items autonomously through a coordinated network of robots.

### Key Features

- **Autonomous Request and Delivery:** Developed a system enabling autonomous item requests and deliveries for patients and medical staff.
- **Multi-Robot Coordination:** Utilized the InOrbit platform to coordinate multiple robots, optimizing task execution with ROS-based orchestration.
- **Precise Mapping and Navigation:** Used LIDAR for precise mapping and autonomous navigation in complex environments with the Create robot.
- **Object Manipulation:** Implemented the Kinova robotic arm for accurate object manipulation, integrated with YOLO-V8 for object detection.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved high accuracy in object handling through extensive parameter tuning and iterative testing.
